# MC-PROJECT
# Real-Time Occupancy Detection System

## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a real-time occupancy detection system that offers energy efficiency. The system utilizes Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and a PIR sensor to automatically control room lights based on the presence of humans. By accurately detecting occupancy, the system aims to optimize energy consumption and reduce unnecessary energy wastage.

## Results
The developed prototype successfully detects the number of people entering and leaving the room using ultrasonic sensors. The PIR sensor detects motion within the room to determine if someone is present. Based on the occupancy status, the system automatically turns on the lights when a person enters the room and turns them off after a certain period of inactivity.

The system offers reliable and accurate occupancy detection, ensuring that the lights are only used when needed. This leads to energy savings and contributes to a more sustainable and efficient use of resources. The prototype can be further customized and integrated into various settings such as homes, offices, schools, and other public spaces.
